Journal Week 8

Having now worked on developing apps for several weeks, what has been suprising is the ability to read others code and 
actually understand what they are doing. Sometimes the function names or properties may still be foreign to me, but
reading through either an Objective-C file or Swift file I am able to see the task they are accomplishing and their
methodology in doing so.

The pace for which we are learning has been fast and expected, but sometimes it's hard for me to feel like I'm ready for 
another information burst and try to swallow as much as I can as it's being throw at us.  Sort of like feeling I can't catch
my breath during a race or something.  But I have found that if I keep showing up and trying, my lungs get some air back and I
can digest another chunk of code crunching!

It is extremely satisfying and fulling after struggling for a bit on getting a function or process to compile and then have
that moment when it seeems like all the parts fall into place. I guess it sometimes feels like putting the final puzzle piece
in to a massive puzzle and getting the feeling of completion (even though I'd say a project is never really finished!).

I wish I could go back and tell myself to embrace the tougher concepts more at the beginning. The coding process is constantly
building on what know and understanding some the complex subjects make for greater ability to scale parts of code and
make reuse if things instead of chaining lines of pattern matching or if statements.  Especially creating custom objects and 
implementing them as much as possible.

Why not cater to exactly what I need and make it my own custom object to use as much as needed in my projects!?
