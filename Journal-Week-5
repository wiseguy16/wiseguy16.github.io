Journal- Week 5

The past week has been challenging.  We covered some heavy topics and didn't seem to stop to catch our breath.  Such topics 
as MapKit, CoreLocation Manager, NSCoding, not to mention starting a brand new coding language Swift. Not just the regular 
Swift version 2, but we jumped into full blown Swift 3 beta!  I've had some previous experience with Swift and the syntax
was familiar, but we decided to make the plunge to Swift 3 because it will make us more exposed to producing apps
that can be ran on brand new iPhone7s.  It's exciting to explore this type of bleeding edge with tech because I can gain 
experience and implement some of the new functions and features. Hopefully this can take my apps further just by knowing more
than the developer who is stuck in his way or unmotivated to learn the changes for the new version release. I am mostly
excited to see how I can utilize their open sourcing of the messaging features because I feel like it could be something
I leverage in my final project.  
  
    Having gone through so much material so quickly, I feel like I have a little bit of side work to do to feel comfortable 
    with the concepts that flew past me.  I will probably make myself do some mini-apps to make sure I can replicate
    some of the Map features as well as storing data to the system manager so that it can persist from app launch to app 
    launch.  Users have come to expect this kind of behavior and won't want to use something if it has to reset every time
    they use it.  Writing code is starting to feel a little more intuitive. I feel like I now know more of the concept
    I'm trying to go for and I try to write it on my own and only look up things if it gets me stuck for more than 5 or so 
    minutes.  Feels pretty good to make the machine do what you're thinking and getting it to do it by what you are typing!
