Journal Week 9

As our lectures are coming to an end and we begin to start our final projects, I think back over my projects from the last
9 weeks and remember 2 moments in particular. One, was a moment where I felt like I was really able to apply the knowledge I 
learning.  That was when we were building a calculator.  It sounds a lot easier than you may think, but thinking through the
logic to implement what a calculator really does was quite a struggle.  You need to determine if the user is entering his first
number, second number or operator. Then you need to apply the proper math based on what they have entered. We first did the
assignment in Objective-c, then later we were given the same assignment to do in Swift.  I felt pretty good when I was able to
have the display give out the correct results and perform the basic calculations when I did it in Objective-C, but it was when
we redid the assignment in Swift that I was able to put all of the calulation functions into their own class, or what we 
called "the brain" and have all of the business logic seperate from the controller that manages the view.  It really was a
defining moment for me as a developer to really grab ahold of this concept!
